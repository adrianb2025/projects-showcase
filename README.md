# Projects Showcase
<p>This repository contains several of my projects that I made in my spare time. Most of these are made in Java, however, as soon as I find the other archived projects(and finished projects) I will upload them here</p>

## Particle System
<p>I created a simple yet cool particle system which follows the mouse and changes color when you click with the mouse. This was a project to learn about bitmaps primarily.</p>

## Grid Pacer
A simple "game" where you can place solid blocks and watch a character without pathfinding make its way to the goal(yellow). 
This was an educational project to teach my cousin about how tiles work. This project was made in 2023.

## Realms
<p>The first attempt at making a game that I managed to finish. I originally started working on this project in 2017, however, in 2022 I stumbled across this project randomly. Based on what I had at the time, I was unsure where I wanted to take it, so, I decided to
give it a realistic scope I could work with. I found some nice pixel art assets and added them to the project. I learned how sprite-wrapping works, how to create a weather system, how to make custom UI stuff, and even how to create a level system. I was heavily inspired by Realm of The Mad God, as the name of the game should imply.</p>

## Phantom Busters
<p>The first failed attempt at making a fun little game. Halfway through development I realized that the scope of this game was too large so I originally wanted to put it on hold temporarily. The original idea of this game was that there were going to be multiple large levels where you and a crew of people(a reverend, a retail worker, and an average joe) had to survive a group of evil phantoms. I later realized that the game wasn't fun so I stopped working on it.</p>

## Bulldozer
<p>This is a remake of the 1994 game, Bulldozer, however, instead of playing as a bulldozer, you play as a rabbit that has to push carrots into holes.</p>

## Jump
<p>This is the latest game project I made. It is essentially a frogger-like game that has a bossfight in the end. It does have a little story, however, that story is not that good. For the record, I did not make the sprites of the game. I only made the font</p>
