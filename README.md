<h2>Particle System</h2>
<p>A very simple particle system which follows your mouse and changes color upon clicking the mouse</p>

<h2>Jump</h2>
<p>A frogger-style game with several events and even a boss fight. There is barely any story but at least there's dialogue before the boss battle</p>

<h2>Phantom Busters</h2>
<p>Originally titled "Retribution", I decided to make a game where you hunt phantoms. I originally inteded for this to be a parody of ghostbusters but with characters that got different attributes. Unfortunately, this project was later scrapped</p>
