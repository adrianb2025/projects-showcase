# Projects Showcase
This repository contains several of my projects that I made in my spare time. Most of these are made in Java, however, as soon as I find the other archived projects(and finished projects) I will upload them here.

# Particle System
I created a simple yet cool particle system which follows the mouse and changes color when you click with the mouse. This was a project to learn about bitmaps primarily.

# Grid Pacer
A simple "game" where you can place solid blocks and watch a character without pathfinding make its way to the goal(yellow). 
This was an educational project to teach my cousin about how tiles work. This project was made in 2023.

# Realms
The first attempt at making a game that I managed to finish. I originally started working on this project in 2017, however, in 2022 I stumbled across this project randomly. Based on what I had at the time, I was unsure where I wanted to take it, so, I decided to
give it a realistic scope I could work with. I found some nice pixel art assets and added them to the project. I learned how sprite-wrapping works, how to make custom UI stuff, and even how to create a level system.
